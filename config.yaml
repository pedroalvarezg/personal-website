    title: "About Me"
    image: "/images/yo2.jpeg"
    content: |-
      I am an actuary with a passion for spatial data science. I have a strong background math/statistics, finance and programming, and I'm very interested in the intersection of technology and health. I also have a strong interest in integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) to approximate Bayesian models.
      I like the automation of processes. But one one of the things that I like the most is to create interactive Maps for data visualization(I also like to make dashboards for data viz).

      I have been working as a full stack data scientist for more than 1 year with experience in retail,TI and spatial analysis. I have worked in proyects for more than 4 companies which gives me the ability to translate complex questions into understandable insights.
